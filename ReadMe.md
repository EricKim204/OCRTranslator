# OCR Translator Extension

A browser extension that translates text from images on any webpage 

## Project Overview

This extension allows users to click on any image within a webpage, automatically extract visible text, translate it into a target language, and overlay the translated text on top of the original image in-place.

## Core Features (Planned)

- Detect and select images on webpages
- Extract embedded text from the image
- Translate the extracted text to a target language
- Overlay the translated text on the image using a transparent or styled layer

## Development Plan

2. Integrate in-browser text extraction
3. Add translation via a remote or local service
4. Render overlay with the translated result on top of the image
5. Add support for custom language selection
6. Improve styling and positioning of the overlay
7. Test across image formats, resolutions, and webpage layouts
